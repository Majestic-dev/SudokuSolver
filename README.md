# About the project

This project is a challenge I made for myself, inspired by me getting pissed trying to solve extreme level sudokus (which I used to do with ease). Goal of the challenge is to create something useful with coding, to expand my ways of thinking when solving problems in code. The main rule for the challenge is to not use any kind of AI (apart from the equation that I use to sort numbers to squares based on row & column number)
