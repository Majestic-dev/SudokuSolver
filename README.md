# About the project

This project is a challenge I made for myself, inspired by me getting pissed trying to solve extreme level sudokus (which I used to do with ease). Goal of the challenge is to create something useful with coding, to expand my ways of thinking when solving problems in code. The main rule for the challenge is to not use any kind of AI (apart from the equation that I use to sort numbers to squares based on row & column number)


# Showcase

My personal best went from 12 minutes and 16 seconds to 2 minutes and 39 seconds on an extreme level sudoku board using this solver (Consider the fact I have to manually enter the board to the program and then back to my phone)

### Note

I find it funny that the easiest way to solve a sudoku using code is just bruteforcing it
